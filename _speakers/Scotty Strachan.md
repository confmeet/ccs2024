2024 status: Since Jan 2022, I've started a new mission area for Research Engineering in the Nevada System of Higher Education, based in System Computing Services. This is a novel role and team designed to: (1) plan/coordinate statewide research cyberinfrastructure across institutions; (2) expand research computing and data networks/services; (3) impact strategic planning for technology; (4) engage and establish regional connectivity partnerships; (5) and support key regional science-based service and engineering projects such as wildfire/climate/hazard observatories, Internet of Things real-world laboratories, and wide-area network telemetry and automation. I continue to lead Team Science projects and proposals as they fit into these objectives.
