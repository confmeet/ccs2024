Dr. Jeffrey Carver’s overall research goal is improving the quality and reliability of software through the use of empirical software engineering, which seeks to provide concrete data, observations, and evidence to support decision-making. He is primarily concerned with the human aspects of software engineering. As such, his research focuses on developing, measuring, and improving processes and tools that will increase software quality with respect to certain attributes, such as cost, correctness, reliability, and security. Empirical software engineering techniques also allow researchers and practitioners to gather information to provide a deeper understanding of the context(s) in which techniques and methods are most useful.

Carver’s specific research interests include science of security research, software security, human errors in software engineering, software engineering for science, and human factors in FLOSS. He has active funding in these areas from the National Science Foundation and the National Security Agency. He has published related research in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, the Empirical Software Engineering journal, IEEE Software, Computing in Science and Engineering, the International Conference on Software Engineering, and the International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement.

He serves on the editorial boards of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, the Empirical Software Engineering journal, IEEE Software, Computing in Science and Engineering, Information and Software Technology, and Software Quality Journal.
