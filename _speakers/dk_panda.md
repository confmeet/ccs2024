DK Panda is a Professor and University Distinguished Scholar of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University.  He serves as the Director of the newly-established $20M NSF-AI Institute, ICICLE (https://icicle.ai). He has published over 500 papers in the area of high-end computing and networking.  The MVAPICH2 (High-Performance MPI and PGAS over InfiniBand, Omni-Path, iWARP, and RoCE) libraries, designed and developed by his research group (http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu), are currently being used by more than 3,200 organizations worldwide (in 89 countries). More than 1.56M downloads of this software have taken place from the project's site. This software is empowering several InfiniBand clusters (including the 4th, 13th, 26th, 38th, and 39th ranked ones) in the TOP500 list. The RDMA packages for Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop, Memcached together with OSU HiBD benchmarks, and MPI4dask from his group (http://hibd.cse.ohio-state.edu) are also publicly available.  These libraries are currently being used by more than 340 organizations in 38 countries. More than 43,000 downloads of these libraries have taken place. High-performance and scalable versions of MPI-driven runtimes for AI (Deep Learning Training and Machine learning (MPI4cuML)) are available from https://hidl.cse.ohio-state.edu. Prof. Panda is an IEEE Fellow. More details about Prof. Panda are available at http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~panda.
