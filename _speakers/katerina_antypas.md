Katie Antypas, division deputy at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), has accepted a short-term position at the National Science Foundation (NSF) as the office director in the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure. In that role, her responsibilities will include overseeing the progress, acquisition, and provision of advanced computing and data, as well as networking resources, tools, and services for the academic and educational communities that the NSF supports.

Antypas came to NERSC in 2006 as a consultant in the User Services Group (USG) and has since served as USG group lead, project director for the NERSC-8 project that led to the deployment of the Cori system in 2017, Data department head, and division deputy, in addition to serving as the Exascale Compute Project director of hardware and integration. For the next few years, she will remain a Berkeley Lab employee but will be on assignment to NSF through the Intergovernmental Personnel Act. This allows her to utilize her extensive experience in collaborating with the research community and leading large-scale projects and system deployments, with a focus on providing infrastructure support to researchers at universities nationwide.
