## Poster Preparation

Each poster presenter will be assigned ½ of one side of a 4’x8’ poster board.
Each poster should be no larger than 45 inches x 45 inches (114cm x 114cm).  You
are free to fill that space however you see fit.  We will provide pushpins.
Please include your project award name, award number, and PI/co-PI names.

We recommend that you also include the keywords that you will use in your
figshare upload (see Digital Upload section of this page).

There will be three poster sessions and you will receive information on which
poster session you will present in prior to the meeting.  Please take down your
posters right after the session.  Posters left after the meeting will be
recycled.

You will need to **print out and bring a physical copy of your poster on your own**;
we cannot print posters on site.  See information on local print shops here.
