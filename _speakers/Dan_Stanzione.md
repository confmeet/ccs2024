Dr. Dan Stanzione, Associate Vice President for Research at The University of Texas at Austin since 2018 and Executive Director of the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) since 2014, is a nationally recognized leader in high performance computing.

He is the principal investigator (PI) for several projects including a multimillion-dollar National Science Foundation (NSF) grant to acquire and deploy Frontera, which will be the fastest supercomputer at a U.S. university. Stanzione is also the PI of TACC's Stampede2 and Wrangler systems, supercomputers for high performance computing and for data-focused applications, respectively. He served for six years as the co-director of CyVerse, a large-scale NSF life sciences cyberinfrastructure in which TACC is a major partner. In addition, Stanzione was a co-principal investigator for TACC's Ranger and Lonestar supercomputers, large-scale NSF systems previously deployed at UT Austin.

Stanzione received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and his master's degree and doctorate in computer engineering from Clemson University, where he later directed the supercomputing laboratory and served as an assistant research professor of electrical and computer engineering.
